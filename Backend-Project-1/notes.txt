1. INITIAL NOTE::

SnP Mode. Short and direct.

### Do **NOT** overthink.

For practice, you want **simple structure + clean logic**.

### Make this:

## **Library Management System (Backend only)**

### Why this scenario

* Slightly richer than “students CRUD”
* Still simple
* Very common in interviews
* Forces relationships and edge cases

---

### Core Scenario

A library has:

* **Books**
* **Members**
* **Issued Books**

---

### Minimum Features (Practice Level)

* Add / update / delete books
* Register members
* Issue a book to a member
* Return a book
* Prevent issuing if:

  * Book already issued
  * Member exceeded limit

---

### What you practice (without realizing)

* CRUD done properly
* Relations (Book ↔ Member)
* State (`available`, `issued`)
* Validation logic
* Simple business rules

---

### What NOT to add

* Payments
* Fine calculation
* Admin dashboards
* Over-engineering

---

### Tech Stack (suggested, not mandatory)

* Node.js + Express
* MongoDB or MySQL
* JWT optional (can skip auth for now)

---

### One-line goal

> “I can design clean CRUD with rules, not just endpoints.”

If you want next:

* I can **list entities only**
* Or **list API routes only**
* Or **list edge cases only**

You choose.


2. CREATING DATA ENTITIES:
- Entities: Book, Member, IssueRecord
- Fields (MongoDB):
a. Books: Book_Name, Author_Name, Edition, No_Of_Pages, Total_Copies, Available_Copies (one library might have 10 copies of same books).
b. Member: Member_Name, Address, Phone, Email, Subs_Date_Start, Subs_Date_End, Issued_Books (Last second and third fields library subscription date start and expiry. For last field max value is 10).
c. IssueRecord: Issue_Date, Return_Date, Book_Id, Member_Id, Status (enum - issue|return).

- Improved (from above)::
- Entities: book, member, issueRecord
- Fields (MongoDB):
a. Books: bookName, authorName, edition, noOfPages, totalCopies, availableCopies (may have multiple copies of same book name).
b. Members: memberName, address, phone, email, subsDateStart (subscription date start), subsDateEnd (subscription date end), issuedBooks (max value is 10).
c. IssueRecords: issueDate, returnDate, bookId, memberId, status (enum - issued|returned)


3. DESIGNING API ROUTES:
- 3 router files in total:

a. Books:
a1. addBookRouter - POST '/api/books' - Add book,
a2. getAllBooksRouter - GET '/api/books' - Get all books,
a3. getBookByIdRouter - GET '/api/books/:id' - Get book by id,
a4. getBookByNameRouter - GET '/api/books/:name' - Get book by name,
a5. updateBookByIdRouter - PUT '/api/books/:id' - Update book by id,
a6. updateBookByNameRouter - PUT '/api/books/:name' - Update book by name,
a7. deleteBookByIdRouter - DELETE '/api/books/:id' - Delete book by id,
a8. deleteBookByNameRouter - DELETE '/api/books/:name' - Delete book by name,

b. Members:
b1. addMemberRouter - POST '/api/members' - Add member,
b2. getAllMemberRouter - GET '/api/members' - Get all members,
b3. getMemberByIdRouter - GET '/api/members/:id', - Get member by id,
b4. getMemberByNameRouter - GET '/api/members/:name' - Get member by name,
b5. updateMemberByIdRouter - PUT '/api/members/:id' - Update member by id,
b6. updateMemberByNameRouter - PUT '/api/members/:name' - Update member by name,
b7. deleteMemberByIdRouter - DELETE '/api/members/:id' - Delete member by id,
b8. deleteMemberByNameRouter - DELETE '/api/members/:name' - Delete member by name,

c. IssuedBooks:
c1. addIssuedBookRouter - POST '/api/issued-books' - Add issued book,
c2. getAllIssuedBookRouter - GET '/api/issued-books' - Get all issued books,
c3. getIssuedBookByIdRouter - GET '/api/issued-books/:id' - Get issued book by id,
c4. getAllIssuedBooksByDateRouter - GET '/api/issued-books/:date' - Get all issued books by date,
c5. getIssuedBookByBookNameRouter (optional, since this will be complex),
c6. updateIssuedBookByIdRouter - PUT '/api/issued-books/:id' - Update issued book by id,
c7. deleteIssuedBookRouter - DELETE '/api/issued-books/:id' - Delete issued book by id

Improved (from above):
a. Books:
a1. addBookRouter - POST '/api/books' - Add book,
a2. getAllBooksRouter - GET '/api/books' - Get all books,
a3. getBookByIdRouter - GET '/api/books/:id' - Get book by id,
a4. updateBookByIdRouter - PUT '/api/books/:id' - Update book by id,
a5. deleteBookByIdRouter - DELETE '/api/books/:id' - Delete book by id,

b. Members:
b1. addMemberRouter - POST '/api/members' - Add member,
b2. getAllMemberRouter - GET '/api/members' - Get all members,
b3. getMemberByIdRouter - GET '/api/members/:id', - Get member by id,
b4. updateMemberByIdRouter - PUT '/api/members/:id' - Update member by id,
b5. deleteMemberByIdRouter - DELETE '/api/members/:id' - Delete member by id,

c. IssuedBooks:
c1. addIssuedBookRouter - POST '/api/issues' - Add issued book,
c2. getAllIssuedBookRouter - GET '/api/issues' - Get all issued books,
c3. getIssuedBookByIdRouter - GET '/api/issues/:id' - Get issued book by id,
c4. updateIssuedBookByIdRouter - PUT '/api/issues/:id' - Update issued book by id,
c5. deleteIssuedBookRouter - DELETE '/api/issues/:id' - Delete issued book by id
