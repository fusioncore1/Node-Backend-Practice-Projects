My Query:
Okay, based on the library management system that we did last time, can you make a test question which is a similar to this project in which I have to create a backend?

ChatGPT:
(You’ll get *requirements, constraints, and evaluation criteria only*. No code.)

---

## Backend Test Question (Library-like, Different Domain)

### Project Title

**Equipment Rental Management System (ERMS)**

### Objective

Design and build a RESTful backend for managing rentable equipment (cameras, tools, machines, etc.), users, and rentals. The system must enforce availability, rental periods, and role-based access—similar in *complexity* to a Library Management System, not identical in domain.

---

## Core Entities (Data Modeling)

1. **User**

   * id
   * name
   * email (unique)
   * role (`ADMIN`, `STAFF`, `CUSTOMER`)
   * isActive
   * createdAt

2. **Equipment**

   * id
   * name
   * category
   * serialNumber (unique)
   * status (`AVAILABLE`, `RENTED`, `MAINTENANCE`)
   * dailyRate
   * createdAt

3. **Rental**

   * id
   * userId
   * equipmentId
   * startDate
   * endDate
   * actualReturnDate (nullable)
   * status (`ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `OVERDUE`, `CANCELLED`)
   * totalCost

4. **MaintenanceLog** (optional but scored)

   * id
   * equipmentId
   * description
   * startDate
   * endDate

---

## Functional Requirements (Must Have)

### Authentication & Authorization

* JWT-based authentication
* Role-based access:

  * **ADMIN**: full access
  * **STAFF**: manage equipment & rentals
  * **CUSTOMER**: view equipment, create rentals, view own rentals

---

### Equipment Management

* Add, update, soft-delete equipment
* List equipment with filters:

  * category
  * status
  * availability for a given date range

---

### Rental Workflow

* Create a rental **only if equipment is AVAILABLE**
* Prevent overlapping rentals for the same equipment
* On rental creation:

  * status → `ACTIVE`
  * equipment status → `RENTED`
* On return:

  * calculate total cost (based on days × dailyRate)
  * mark overdue if returned after endDate
  * equipment status → `AVAILABLE`

---

### Business Rules (Important)

* One equipment → one active rental at a time
* In `MAINTENANCE`, equipment cannot be rented
* Rental dates must be validated (start < end, no past dates)
* A user cannot have more than **N active rentals** (choose a number and justify)

---

## API Expectations (High Level)

You must design routes for:

* Auth (register/login)
* Equipment CRUD
* Rental create / return / list
* Admin/Staff views vs Customer views

> You are evaluated on **route design**, not route count.

---

## Validation & Error Handling

* Request validation (body, params, query)
* Meaningful HTTP status codes
* Clear error messages (no generic “Something went wrong”)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

* Clean project structure
* Separation of concerns (routes / controllers / services / models)
* Environment-based configuration
* Consistent naming conventions

---

## Bonus (Optional, Scored Separately)

* Pagination & sorting
* Maintenance logs affecting availability
* Rental history analytics (most rented equipment)
* Unit tests for business rules

---

## Evaluation Criteria (What I’d Check)

1. Data modeling correctness
2. Enforcement of business rules
3. Authorization correctness
4. Edge-case handling
5. Code organization & clarity
6. Real-world thinking (not tutorial code)

---

If you want:

* **Hard mode** → I’ll add race-condition scenarios
* **Interview mode** → I’ll add trick requirements
* **MongoDB-only or SQL-only constraints** → say the word

SnP mode stays on until you deactivate it.




My Query:
This will be a practice question for interview and so I want to frame this practical question just like an interview. Please do that as well. Thanks.

ChatGPT:
Framed exactly like an **interview practical assignment**. No hints, no solutions.

# Backend Interview Practical Assignment

### Time

**2–3 hours**

### Allowed

* Internet (docs only)
* Any backend framework of your choice
* Any database of your choice

### Not Allowed

* Code generators / AI code completion
* Copy-pasting full projects

---

## Problem Statement

You are required to design and implement a **backend service** for an **Equipment Rental Management System**.

The system will be used by a company that rents out physical equipment (tools, cameras, machines) to customers for short durations.

Your task is to expose REST APIs that manage users, equipment, and rentals while enforcing real-world business constraints.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Roles

Implement authentication with the following roles:

* **ADMIN**
* **STAFF**
* **CUSTOMER**

Role behavior:

* ADMIN has full access
* STAFF can manage equipment and rentals
* CUSTOMER can browse equipment and rent items

---

### 2. Equipment Management

Each equipment item must have:

* Unique identifier
* Name
* Category
* Daily rental price
* Status: `AVAILABLE`, `RENTED`, `MAINTENANCE`

Required operations:

* Create equipment
* Update equipment details
* List equipment with filters
* Soft delete equipment

Equipment in `MAINTENANCE` must not be rentable.

---

### 3. Rental Management

A rental represents a customer renting one equipment item for a time period.

Rental must include:

* Equipment reference
* Customer reference
* Start date
* End date
* Status

Rules:

* Equipment cannot have more than one **active** rental at a time
* Overlapping rentals for the same equipment are not allowed
* On rental creation:

  * Equipment status must change accordingly
* On rental return:

  * Calculate total cost
  * Detect overdue rentals

---

### 4. Business Constraints

* Users cannot rent more than **X** items simultaneously
  (Choose a reasonable number and document it)
* Start date must be before end date
* Rentals cannot start in the past
* Returning an already returned rental must fail

---

### 5. API Design

* Design clean and logical REST endpoints
* Proper use of HTTP status codes
* Consistent response structure

You are **not** evaluated on UI or frontend.

---

## What We Are Evaluating

We are **not** looking for the most features.

We are evaluating:

1. Ability to model real-world entities
2. Enforcement of business rules
3. Clean separation of concerns
4. Error handling and validations
5. Code readability
6. Trade-off decisions (documented)

---

## Submission Expectations

Your submission must include:

* Source code
* `.env.example`
* `README.md` containing:

  * Setup instructions
  * API overview
  * Assumptions made
  * Limitations

---

## Bonus (Optional)

* Pagination
* Sorting
* Basic unit tests
* Simple analytics endpoint (e.g., most rented equipment)

---

## Interview Follow-Up Questions (You *will* be asked)

Be prepared to explain:

* How you prevented double booking
* How you handled race conditions
* Why you chose your DB
* How this system would scale
* What you would refactor with more time

---

### Final Note (Interview Tone)

> Focus on **correctness and clarity**, not perfection.
> A smaller, well-designed system beats a large broken one.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Act as the **interviewer** and review your solution
* Convert this into a **hard system-design round**
* Create a **grading rubric** used by real companies

Say the word.



My Query:
What equipments are we dealing with in this business?

ChatGPT:

### Equipment Scope (Defined for This Assignment)

Assume the business rents **mid-value, serialized physical equipment** — not consumables.

You are dealing with:

#### Primary Categories

* **Photography / Video**

  * DSLR / Mirrorless cameras
  * Lenses
  * Tripods
  * Lighting kits
* **Construction / Industrial**

  * Drilling machines
  * Welding machines
  * Power tools
* **Event & Production**

  * Sound systems
  * Projectors
  * LED panels
* **General Utility**

  * Generators
  * Measuring instruments

---

### Important Constraints (Implicit but Expected)

* Each equipment item:

  * Is **individually identifiable** (serial number / asset tag)
  * Can be rented **by only one customer at a time**
  * Has a **daily rental cost**
* No partial rentals (you rent the whole item, not hours)
* No consumables (nothing that gets used up)

---

### Why This Scope Was Chosen (Interview Logic)

* Forces **availability checks**
* Forces **overlap prevention**
* Makes **maintenance status meaningful**
* Maps cleanly to a **library → rental** mental model

---

### What You Should NOT Assume

* No bulk inventory (e.g., “10 cables”)
* No hourly pricing
* No delivery/logistics tracking
* No damage deposits (unless you add it as an assumption)

---

### Interview Tip (Very Important)

If the interviewer asks this and you answer:

> “Assume serialized rentable equipment like cameras and power tools.”

That is a **strong, sufficient answer**.

Over-explaining here is a red flag in interviews.

---

If you want, next I can:

* Help you write the **README assumptions section**
* Ask you **mock interviewer follow-up questions**
* Turn this into a **system design whiteboard discussion**

Say what you want next.
